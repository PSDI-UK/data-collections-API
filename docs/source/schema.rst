Metadata Format
===============

The metadata file may be either in a `json <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`__ or `yaml <https://yaml.org>`__ format.

Each community may have their own metadata requirements, which are all encompassed in the ``custom_fields.dsmd`` field, the full list of supported schemas is available in the :doc:`schemas/index` section.
